‚ô¶ Isomer - Be Collaborative!
============================

**A collaborative and modular infrastructure for your data.**

* **Geo Information** Use a sophisticated map to annotate and review
  geographical information
* **Vehicle support** Attach a sailyacht, your camper or pack one in your
  backpack
* **Project planning** Issue tracking for collaborative teams
* **Modular** Expandable with integrated modules or build your own
* **Cloud independent** Run nodes on your own infrastructure

Much more incoming!

‚õÅ Installation
==============

Please be wary of bugs and report strange things, thank you!

‚ñ∫ Docker: Yes, please!
----------------------

If you just want to try it out or generally are happy with using docker, there
is no need to clone the repo, just download the docker compose file and get
everything from docker hub:

.. code-block:: sh

    wget https://github.com/isomeric/isomer/raw/master/docker/docker-compose-hub.yml
    docker-compose -f docker-compose-hub.yml up

See the `docker detail page
<https://isomer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/system/docker.html#docker-details>`__
for more information.


‚òì Docker: No, thanks..
----------------------

There is more than one way of installing Isomer, `see the detailed instructions
for those <https://isomer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/start/quick.html>`__.

If you intend to set up a development environment, `please follow the
development workflow instructions
<https://isomer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/workflow.html>`__.


‚äï Modules
=========

The system is modular, so you can install what you need and leave out other
things.

A lot of the included modules are still Work in Progress, so help out, if
you're interested in a powerful - **cloud independent** - collaboration tool
suite.

‚ô® General modules
-----------------

These are 'official' isomer modules. If you'd like to contribute your own,
ping riot@c-base.org, to get it added to the list.

Some (marked with \*) are work in progress and probably not really usable, yet.

Again, help is very welcome!
