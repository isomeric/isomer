Development Introduction
========================


Here's how we do things in Isomer...

If you're looking for instructions on how to set up a development environment,
please check out :ref:`the workflow documentation <environment>`.

Communication
-------------

- `#hackerfleet IRC Channel`_ on the `FreeNode IRC Network`_
- `Issue Tracker`_ located at `https://github.com/isomeric/isomer/issues`


.. note:: If you are familiar with
        `IRC <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat>`_
        and use your own IRC Client then connect to the FreeNode Network and
        ``/join #hackerfleet``.


Standards
---------

We use the following coding standard:

- `PEP-008 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_

We also lint our codebase with the following tools:

- `pyflakes <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyflakes>`_
- `pep8 <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pep8>`_
- `mccabe <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mccabe/0.2.1>`_

Please ensure your Development IDE or Editor has the above
linters and checkers in place and enabled.

Alternatively you can use the following command line tool:

- `flake8 <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/flake8>`_
