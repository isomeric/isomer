Operational Acceptance Testing
==============================

.. warning:: These tests take a long time!

Citing :cite:`wiki:oat` about OAT:

    Operational acceptance testing (OAT) is used to conduct operational readiness (pre-release) of a product, service,
    or system as part of a quality management system. [..] This type of testing focuses on the operational readiness of
    the system to be supported, and/or to become part of the production environment.
